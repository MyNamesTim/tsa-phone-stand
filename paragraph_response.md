I created a phone stand that can be rotated in two different ways. The base column of the stand, which supports the phone holder, can be rotated to adjust the height and front to back movement of the phone holder. The angle that the phone holder is facing can also be adjusted and rotated, and it can be adjusted to face different angles going from top to bottom. The stand is fully made out of aluminum, and includes a square base that is 88.9 mm wide/long. Its supporting/moving column is 133.5477644 mm tall and has two holes on the top and bottom for rivets to fit through, which attach it to two clamps. These clamps and rivets allow the rotating and tilting of the moving parts of the base. The holder portion of the stand is 182.8976276 mm tall and 101.6 mm wide. It is made to fit the biggest of commercial phones. The stand weighs 462.163133909 grams.
